# K-Mean
A programm to find K-Means with cluster-data wiritten by Java.
Get KMean point through
                        1.get random centroid point from random data point
                        2.separate data point by nearest centroid
                        3.do average and get new centroid
                        4.repeat 2 and 3 until converge
                        repeat 1-4 for specified times and select the most frequency result to print out(to solve overlapping clusters)
